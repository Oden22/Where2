This is the Where2 project by Oden Baker, Adam Gorring, Joshua Thomas and Brayden Maher 

This project can be accessed through (https://github.com/Macbeagle/Where2/) where it is currently being hosted. 
Information on how to install and run the server locally is in the following paragraph. 

This project was built through a python virtual environment allowing the packages to be stored in a central container. 
All packages have been exported from this environment and stored into the requirements.txt file located in the main folder.
To install these requirements, run “pip install -r requirements.txt” from the command line interface from within the same directory. 
After the packages are installed, cd into where2_core and run the command, “python manage.py runserver” and the Django server will be booted on your device. 
Alternatively if you have newer 64 bit versions of Windows 10, Git installed or Linux the run.sh bash script should launch the program.
